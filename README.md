# Weather Dashboard
This is a weather dashboard that allows a traveler to see the weather and a five day forecast for multiple cities. When a city name is entered the current weather is presented as well as a five day forecast. Recent searches are added to a search history to make it easy to return to that city's weather. Weather information includes an icon to represent the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UVI. The UVI has color coding to show whether it is favorable, moderate, severe and extreme.
